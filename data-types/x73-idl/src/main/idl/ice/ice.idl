 * These are the data types and topic names used by the OpenICE system.
 * 
 * A nominal level of namespacing.  In java this will create an ice
 * package.  In C++ this will create a namespace.  In C this will create
 * a name prefix.  Type names will also be scoped with an "ice::" prefix.
 * We do not use such a prefix in topic names because colons are not legal
 * characters for use in DDS topics per section A.2 of the DDS spec version 1.2
 * http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.2/
 * 
 * Excerpted...
 * TOPICNAME - A topic name is an identifier for a topic, and is defined as any 
 * series of characters ‘a’, ..., ‘z’, ‘A’, ..., ‘Z’, ‘0’, ..., ‘9’, ‘-’ but may 
 * not start with a digit.
 *
 * Note: the #pragma syntax for specifying key fields is used by PrismTech OpenSplice.
 * The RTI Connext code generator currently uses the //@key syntax and will generate
 * harmless warnings about the #pragma definitions in its preprocessing step.
 * 
 * The stability of each data model element will be ranked on a scale 0 to 5.
 * For more information on the stability levels.
 * http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index
 * A better definition of backward-compatibility is required here with respect to the
 * Extensible Types Addendum to DDS.  i.e. backward compatibility is influenced
 * by the use of markers for extensible types (indicating parameterized CDR)
